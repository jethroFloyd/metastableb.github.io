Position Absolute : Positions the element absolute to the nearest relatively
        positioned element or the viewport, which ever occurs first.
If a position element is not given , the elements position themselves to the
    nearest positioned element.

    /*
 * children elements ignore min-height when calculating
 * their own height, and hence absolute values are required here.
