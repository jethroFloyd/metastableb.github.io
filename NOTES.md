# Development behaviour
Beta subdomain is developed in `dev/beta` branch. This is pulled to the corresponding directory `b_root` on the server.

Similarly, stable site is developed in `dev/stable` and pulled to corresponding directory in `default_root`. 

Do not forget to modify `config.xml` depending on the branch you are pulling on the host machine.
