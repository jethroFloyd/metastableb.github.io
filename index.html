						Hello!

					<div class="row about-text">
						<p>Here you might find some information about my work, interests and opinions. I spent most of my early childhood in God's own country - Kerala. My time was dedicated to playing cricket with kits made of coconut tree leaves, fishing in the lakes nearby and climbing trees for guava fruits. Those were truly wonderful days!</p>
						<p>Around the time I was 10, we moved to the majestic Delhi. Delhi was a totally different experience for me and exposed me to the best of the best in everything! I made a whole lot of great friends and great memories living here. I come home to Delhi whenever I get time!</p>
						<p>Currently I'm pursuing my undergraduate studies at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Patna.</p>
						<p>I love listening to and discovering new music. Occasionally I write and also play the guitar.</p>
						<p>I am a huge Pink Floyd Fan!.</p>

						<p>I'm a coffee to code guy.
						<br> I love my coffee and I love my code.
						</p>
						<p>I mainly work at the lower level of computing, near the hardware software interface. Operating systems, kernel programming and embedded systems are things I spend a lot of time on. Having said that, I've had experience working on scale as well, specifically Big Data and MapReduce. I love working on machine learning tasks and try to keep updated on the latest developments in the field. Recently, I've started to venture into web development as well. 
						You can find a detailed description of the projects I have been a part on in the following section.
						</p>
						<p>I am always looking for new and interesting opportunities. If you have anything for me, feel free to shoot me an email.</p>
