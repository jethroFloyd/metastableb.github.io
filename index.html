				    <p>This is me populating my super alpha version of the website with some super alpha content. I was never a fan of web development, though things have started to change. The plan here is to develop a layout first, figure out more about HTML/CSS and the bootstrap framerwork and then get to content creation.</p>

					<p>I'm currently a little short on time, and have a lot of things to finish this December - possible delays hence.</p>
					
					<p>Thanks for checking in!</p>

				This is the work section.
				Here goes some of my awesome projects and some not so awesome projects. I'll add my previous stuff here soon, both major and minor. I also plan to add links to content I'm working on and blog entries regarding them here as well.
				</p>
				<p>
				By the end of this month, I expect to finish with a DJANGO project and a small TCP/IP server and some JS. No, not academic requirements. I just love to fiddle with new things :D (never have been great with academic stuffs anyway!)

				The plan here is to give a preview of my blog articles. I don't expect people to read it (just yet ;)). But I'll get to learn some dynamic content preview generation 
				after I get into DJANGO and get a chance to implement it here.</p>
				<p>
				GitHutb (where I'm hosting) already has some kind of a platform for blogs, will check that out as well.</p>
