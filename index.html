		<p><i>Hi there <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i></i> </p>
		<p> I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India working on machine learning for tiny (really really really tiny) devices. I work primarily with <a href="http://www.prateekjain.org/">Prateek</a>, <a href="http://manikvarma.org/">Manik</a>, <a href="http://harsha-simhadri.org/">Harsha</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~naga86/home.html">Naga</a> and others from our group. </p>

		<p>We refer to the work that we are doing as our <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML/wiki/">Embedded Devices Expedition</a>.<span class="dark-alleys"> (In dark alleys and shadow economies, we have been referred to as EdgeML, Edge of Machine Learning and The Dank Group. Whispers have been heard.)</span></p>

		<p>I am a huge Pink Floyd fan and as a whole, I am a `Systems` guy - I like to tinker around with embedded boards, micro-controllers, new tools and tricks and so forth. I am primarily driven by my curiosity about ideas loosely defined in cognitive science and that manifest, in some sense, in machine learning, deep learning and statistical inference.</p>

		<p>This is my new web-page, remodeled to be minimalistic and clean, moving away from my dark and glittery blunder-years-in-retrospect. I checkout new features or incomplete work on my <a href="https://b.dkdennis.xyz">beta</a> subdomain for testing purposes and (plan to) host projects on a separate <a href="https://p.dkdennis.xyz">subdomain</a>. <span class="dark-alleys">(I had plans to host a blog as well, -- had, -- plans)</span>. Feel free to look around.</p>

		<p>Below are links to my social media and Github accounts. Feel free to ping to say HI. <br>
		<br>
		Cheers! <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>
