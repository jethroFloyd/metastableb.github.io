		<p><i>Hi there <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i></i> 
		<br>I am an undergraduate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna. I am currently in my final semester here.</p>

		<p>I identify myself as a full time computer enthusiast, though my interests vary a lot with time. Over the years, I have written and directed plays, have been a forward for our football team and have been the drummer of a band.</p> 

		<p>I am a huge Pink Floyd fan!</p>

		<p>You'll find a lot of boards, chips and other electronic equipment in my room as I like to tinker around with embedded boards, micro-controllers and IoT devices in my leisure time. My primary drive though, revolves around my curiosity about ideas loosely defined in cognitive science and manifested, in some sense, in machine learning, deep learning and statistical inferencing. Currently I am working on deep learning and robotics and am looking for opportunities in these fields. Shoot me an email if you have something for me!</p>

		<p>This is my new web-page, remodeled to be minimalistic and clean. I used to host a much more glittery design previously. I checkout new features or incomplete work on my <a href="https://b.dkdennis.xyz">beta</a> website for testing purposes and (plan to) host projects on a separate <a href="https://p.dkdennis.xyz">subdomain</a>. Feel free to look around.</p>

		<p>Below are links to my social media and Github accounts. Feel free to contact me if you have anything to say. <br>
		<br>
		Cheers! <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>
