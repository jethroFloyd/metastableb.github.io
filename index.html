    <p> I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, where I work with
    <a href="http//www.prateekjain.org">Prateek</a> and <a href =
    "http://harsha-simhadri.org">Harsha</a> in the  <a
    href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-and-optimization/">
    Machine Learning and Optimisation (MLO)</a> group and<a
    href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/machine-learning-edge/">
  Intelligent Devices Expedition</a> group. I do research on bringing
state-of-the-art machine learning to severely resource-constrained devices.  I
am slated to finish my research fellowship at Microsoft Research in Spring
2019 after which I hope to work towards securing a PhD.</p>

    <p>My current research follows a bottom-up approach in which I go back to
    the drawing board to design theoretically sound and practical machine
    learning algorithms that can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
    being aware of the resource constraints imposed. For instance,
    <ul>
      <li>With my EMI-RNN work (accepted at NeurIPS '18), we were able to
        speed-up RNN inference by up to 72x while gaining on performance. As a
        concrete application, EMI-RNN brought real-time key-word spotting to
        devices like Raspberry Pi0 and MXChip. A demonstration was accepted at
        the MLPCD workshop at NeurIPS '18.
      </li>
      <li>The ProtoNN (prototypes + kNN) based machine learning pipeline I
        developed for <i>GesturePod</i> (in submission, CHI '19) is able to do
        robust and accurate real-time gesture recognition on 32kB of RAM and a
        48MHz processor. GesturePod has been widely covered  by the media [<a

        <p>Outside my current, more academic focus, I am also interested in societal

        gloriously failed at building a startup - <i>Weave</i>, focused on

        Rito and Prashant continue to work on the product and managerial side
        of things. With some of the amazing, experienced people we met during
        our time at Weave they lead the push for democratising healthcare
