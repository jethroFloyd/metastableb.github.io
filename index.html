	Navbar header seems to be the portion of the navbar that always seems to be present.

	the bootstrap collapse class indicates collapsible elements, which can collapse expand on click.
	To control (show/hide) the collapsible content, add the data-toggle="collapse" attribute to an <a> or a <button> element. Then add the data-target="#id" attribute to connect the button with the collapsible content (<div id="demo">).

	Note: For <a> elements, you can use the href attribute instead of the data-target attribute

				This is me populating my super alpha version of the website with some super alpha version content. I was never a fan of web development though, things have started to change.

				I'm currently a little short on time, and have a lot of things to finish this December. I'll fill everything up here eventually.
				
				Thanks for checking in!

			This is the work section.
			Here goes my awesome projects and a lot of not so awesome projects. By the end of this month, I expect to finish with a DJANGO project and a small TCP/IP server and some JS. No, not academic requirements. I just love to fiddle with new things :D (never have been great with academic stuffs anyway!)

			Ah, a collection of things I'v written and things I'v failed to write. (Ok that didn't make much sense did it ?).
			<br> 
			The plan here is to give a preview of my blog articles. I don't expect people to read it (just yet ;)). But I'll get to learn some dynamic content preview generation 
			after I get into DJANGO and get a chance to implement it here.
			<br>
			GitHutb (where I'm hosting) already has some kind of a platform for blogs, will check that out as well.

	TODO:
		[ ] Fix the weird drop down auto align behavior.
			Reproduction: Just pull the drop down menu down,

		[ ] Add a better transition to the navbar button
