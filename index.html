		<p><i>Hi there  <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i></i> </p>
    <p>I am a Research Fellow in the <a
      href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-and-optimization/'>
      Machine Learning and Optimization (MLO)</a> group and the <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/machine-learning-edge/">
      Intelligent Devices Expedition (IDE)</a> at Microsoft Research India
    working on bringing machine learning and intelligence to tiny, edge and end
      point devices - think devices with few KBs of RAM and bare minimum
      processing capabilities. I am advised by <a
      href="http://www.prateekjain.org">Prateek</a> and <a
    href="http://harsha-simhadri.org">Harsha</a>. </p>

    <p > My research focuses on developing and analysing machine learning
    algorithms that ensures state-of-the art performance in resource
    constrained environments. I am also interested in understanding the systems
    aspects of such environments, how ML algorithms and the devices that they
    work on interact and how such interactions can be made efficient. The
    <a>GesturePod</a> and <a>WakeWord</a> projects that I am working on
    currently are specific examples of how novel machine learning ideas with
    efficient on device implementations can give rise to amazing practical and
    durable <i>intelligent devices</i>.  The <a>EMI-RNN</a> algorithm (accepted at
    NIPS '18) we recently developed is an example of a machine learning
    technique that shines in the resource constrained setting.</p>

    <p>I one of the first and a core contributor of <a href="http://www.github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML">EdgeML</a>
     - our machine learning library for edge devices. Along with <a
       href="https://adityakusupati.github.io">Aditya</a>, I develop and
     maintain our Tensorflow code base.</p

     <p><b>Research Interests</b>
     <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, and
     its applications and interactions with systems and devices. Broadly, I am
     interested in the theory and application of ML algorithms that can solve
     real world problems. I am also interested in getting such algorithms
     to work on interesting devices.</p>

     <p>Cheers! <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>
