		<p><i>Hi there <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i></i> 
		<br>I recently graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna with a bachelors degree in Computer Science.</p>

		<p>Presently, I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India working on machine learning for tiny (really really really tiny) devices. I work primarily with Prateek, Manik, Harsha, Naga and other from our group. Our project is codenamed EdgeML and we refer to it often as our Embeded Device Expedition. We recently released the EdgeML repository on github with implementations of our algorithms. The algorithms developed and the results obtained were also reported to ICML this year.</p> 

		<p>I am a huge Pink Floyd fan!</p>

		<p>As a whole, I am a `Systems` guy - I like to tinker around with embedded boards, micro-controllers,new tools and tricks and so forth, in my leisure time. My primary drive though, revolves around my curiosity about ideas loosely defined in cognitive science and that manifest, in some sense, in machine learning, deep learning and statistical inferencing.</p>

		<p>This is my new web-page, remodeled to be minimalistic and clean. I used to host a much more glittery design previously. I checkout new features or incomplete work on my <a href="https://b.dkdennis.xyz">beta</a> website for testing purposes and (plan to) host projects on a separate <a href="https://p.dkdennis.xyz">subdomain</a>. Feel free to look around.</p>

		<p>Below are links to my social media and Github accounts. Feel free to contact me if you have anything to say. <br>
		<br>
		Cheers! <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>
