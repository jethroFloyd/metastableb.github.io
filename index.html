		<p><i>Hi there <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i></i> 
		<br>I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna. I will return to IIT Patna for my final year after this summer.</p>

		<p>I am currently in Singapore, as part of my summer internship at the Singapore University of Technology and Design at the CS2 (Center for Smart Systems) Lab. Prof Lim Hock Beng and Dr Vishram Mishra are my mentors here. We are working on a host of problems that includes network and data center setup, sensor network based data collection, universal smart system gateways, data analytics with Singapore weather data and so on. </p>

		<p>My interests are primarily in embedded programming, architecture and machine learning. I am looking for opportunities in these fields. <a href="/res" class="a-rm-deco" style="color:#FF1C00;">Here</a> are some of the things I have done till now.</p>

		<p>This is my new web-page, remodeled to be minimalistic and clean. I used to have one based on bootstrap but that turned out to be waay too sparkley.</p>

		<p>Below are links to my social media and Github accounts. Feel free to contact me if you have anything to say.<br>
		Cheers! <i class="fa fa-smile-o socio-icons" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>
