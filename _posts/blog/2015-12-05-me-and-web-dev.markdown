summary: Finally! I started to work on my web dev skills!
---

I have never been a fan of web development, especially front-end work. I've done very little web development in the past and the very little work I have done was just applying basic formatting and editing on available content. Yes I admit, I'm a thief. Not proud, nope!

This had to change! 

So, along with other things I planned to do this December, I put web-dev on the list. The plan was to start with some CSS/HTML/JS stuff on the front end, spend say 3-4 days on it, move with DJANGO on the back end for a week or so and then move on to other tasks.

I first started to work on Jekyll and Bootstrap. Read some material off the Internet and voila, off I go. Designing part was not as easy, the back-end for me was relatively easier. I mean to get all the CSS attributes to behave on all platforms equally, gracefully degrade and dealing with IE, man! It's like a spoiled six year old.

**HELLO**
So the greatest pain of the day has been getting a footer of a page to stick to the bottom of the page when the content is too short. I haven't figured out a way to do this. All the different methods (wrappers, flexboxes) have some defect or the other. 

**WHY CANT WEB DEVELOPMENT BE SIMPLER!**
Okay, this is just me going through the initial steep learning phase. Even still, the lack of a seemingly clear and modular structure of development, supported across different browsers, is frustrating. It goes to show how complex the web browser structure is! 

Anyway, for now I've resorted to use a `position: fixed;` footer for smaller content as a work around. Not elegant. Not elegant at all.

It has been about 5 days since I started out on this task of learning HTML CSS and some basic web development and it has been rewarding. I have finally been able to put up the front page of my website using a responsive design. Currently am in search of a better layout for my blog and once I have that I can say that 90% of my work is really complete. Now, we all know how difficult it is taking it from the 90% mark to the 99% mark right.

Its going to be incremental work from now. I'll clean up these articles one by one, fix minor layout and JS issues, and some transitions and so forth.
