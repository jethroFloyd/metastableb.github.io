summary: Background work for SUTD internship

The following content is in preparation for a project at SUTD, Singapore. This is some background work required for the project.

#### Cognitive Radio

>Most of the radio frequency spectrum was inefficiently utilized. For example, cellular network bands are overloaded in most parts of the world, but amateur radio and paging frequencies are not. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation, and concluded that spectrum utilization depends strongly on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used by unlicensed users, even when their transmissions would not interfere at all with the assigned service. This was the reason for allowing unlicensed users to utilize licensed bands whenever it would not cause any interference. 
This paradigm for wireless communication is known as cognitive radio. More specifically, the cognitive radio technology will enable the users to determine which portions of the spectrum is available and detect the presence of licensed users when a user operates in a licensed band (**spectrum sensing**), (2) select the best available channel (**spectrum management**), (3) coordinate access to this channel with other users (**spectrum sharing**), and (4)vacate the channel when a licensed user is detected (**spectrum mobility**).

### Papers
The following section describes various papers which deal with MAC protocol on cognitive radio networks. I have composed a brief summary of all of them.

#### Distributed MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks: Design, Analysis and Optimizations 


Motivation: MAC protocol for dynamic spectrum sharing among multiple secondary users, incorporates spectrum sensing for protecting primary users.
