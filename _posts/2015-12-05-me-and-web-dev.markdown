I have never been a fan of web development, especially front-end work. I've done very little web development in the past and the very little work I have done was just applying basic formatting and editing on available content.

This had to change! 

So, along with other things I planned to do this December, I put webdev of the list. The plan was to start with some CSS/HTML/JS stuff on the front end, spend say 3-4 days on it, move with DJANGO on the back end for a week or so and then move on to other tasks.

As things stand now, I've done some basic CSS and HTML stuff, am developing in bootstrap and have started working on `jekyll` as well.

I'll brain dump here as things develop.
