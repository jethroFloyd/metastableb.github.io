I have never been a fan of web development, especially front-end work. I've done very little web development in the past and the very little work I have done was just applying basic formatting and editing on available content.

This had to change! 

So, along with other things I planned to do this December, I put webdev of the list. The plan was to start with some CSS/HTML/JS stuff on the front end, spend say 3-4 days on it, move with DJANGO on the back end for a week or so and then move on to other tasks.

As things stand now, I've done some basic CSS and HTML stuff, am developing in bootstrap and have started working on `jekyll` as well.

I'll brain dump here as things develop.

So the greatest pain of the day has been getting a footer of a page to stick to the bottom of the page when the content is too short. I haven't figured out a way to do this. All the different methods (wrappers, flexboxes) have some deffect or the other. 

WHY CANT WEB DEVELOPMENT BE SIMPLER!
Okay, this is just me going through the initial steep learning phase. Even still the lack of a seemingly clear and modular structure of development, supported across different browsers is frustrating. It goes to show how complex the web browser structure is! I guess all device responsive development is some what like Microsoft, just trying to figure out one way or the other to make your products work.

Anyway, for now I've resorted to use a `position: fixed;` footer for smaller content as a work around. Not elegant. Not elegant at all.
