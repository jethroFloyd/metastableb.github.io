I have never been a fan of web development, especially front-end work. I've done very little web development in the past and the very little work I have done was just applying basic formatting and editing on available content.

This had to change! 

So, along with other things I planned to do this December, I put webdev of the list. The plan was to start with some CSS/HTML/JS stuff on the front end, spend say 3-4 days on it, move with DJANGO on the back end for a week or so and then move on to other tasks.

As things stand now, I've done some basic CSS and HTML stuff, am developing in bootstrap and have started working on `jekyll` as well.

I'll brain dump here as things develop.

So the greatest pain of the day has been getting a footer of a page to stick to the bottom of the page when the content is too short. I haven't figured out a way to do this. All the different methods (wrappers, flexboxes) have some deffect or the other. 

WHY CANT WEB DEVELOPMENT BE SIMPLER!
Okay, this is just me going through the initial steep learning phase. Even still the lack of a seemingly clear and modular structure of development, supported across different browsers is frustrating. It goes to show how complex the web browser structure is! I guess all device responsive development is some what like Microsoft, just trying to figure out one way or the other to make your products work.

Anyway, for now I've resorted to use a `position: fixed;` footer for smaller content as a work around. Not elegant. Not elegant at all.

I'm thinking of creating a private ideas dump/brain dump/ thoughts dump kind of thing for my page. Then I'm going to open source it.

Yeah yeah I know, I know, twitter already does that right ?
But twitter is not personal, its your thoughts for the world. For someone like me who has a lot of thinks filled in his mind he wants to flush out this would be perfect.

I mean you wont have the pressure of number of retweets or number of likes or number of comments but you still get a medium to write something.

NOTE TO SELF : allow for comments, but hide them until asked for.

Not the line separating a blog and such a brain dump is blurry to say the least. I guess Blogs are for thought out detailed description of ideas, opinion or even experience with a specific flavor or bias towards a subject while this dump will be a spontaneous act of creation ?

It has been about 5 days since I started out on this task of learning HTML CSS and some basic web development and it has been rewarding. I have finally been able to put up the front page of my website using a responsive design. Currently am in search of a better layout for my blog and once I have that I can say that 90% of my work is really complete. Now, we all know how difficult it is taking it from the 90% mark to the 99% mark right.

Its going to be incremental work from now. I'll clean up these articles one by one, fix minor layout and JS issues, and some transitions and so forth. Other tasks in the TODO list is organizing articles in categories, making a site map for SEO and so forth.
